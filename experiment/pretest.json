        "a": "Diffusion is related but not primarily connected to viscosity.",
        "b": "Adhesive force is not the dominant factor for viscosity.",
        "c": "Cohesive forces between molecules influence viscosity most strongly.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Glycerin has very high viscosity due to strong intermolecular forces.",
        "b": "Air has very low viscosity.",

        "a": "High temperature isn't the primary reason for floating.",
        "b": "Viscosity isn't the factor in cloud buoyancy.",
